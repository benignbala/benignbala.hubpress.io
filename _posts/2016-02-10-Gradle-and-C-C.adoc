= Gradle and C/C++
:hp-tags: Gradle, C, C++, Builds

*Gradle* is an amazing build tool mainly for the Java/JVM ecosystem. It revolutionises the way build files/build scripts are written. Gradle is one of the two reasons that made me look at the Java ecosystem again, after a period of almost 10 years (the other being _The Groovy Programming Language_.) In the Java/JVM world, gradle is the best tool that we have got today. It deviates from the XML representaion of _Ant_ and _Maven_, and uses a proper *DSL* to represent the build. Moreover, it deviates from the traditional tools in another way - It is implemted in allows the use of a full fledged programming language (Groovy). 

To build a simple/trivial Java or Groovy project, all that is needed in the build file is just the following one line.

[source, groovy]
....
// build.gradle
apply plygin: 'java' // 'groovy' for groovy projects
....

That's a complete build file that automatically creates the build directory structure and the jars.
